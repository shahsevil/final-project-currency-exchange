## The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build an application that can monitor the currency exchange rates on specific time intervals. 

## How everything should work: 
The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

1) Open the login page, choose the `Create account` option
2) Get redirected to the `Sign Up` page, fill in the form and press the `Create account` button
3) Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press `login`
4) Get redirected to the `Landing page`, where the user can press the `Get Started` button and get redirected to the `Main page`
5) Here the user can select two currencies of favour and press the `Exchange` button. He will be greated with the results on both sides of the `Exchange` button. However, if the user is authorized - he may also pick specific dates to see how the currency exchange rate fluctuates. (See the `main-page-authorized.html` file)
6) If an authorized user has picked the dates and clicked the `Exchange` button - he will be redirected to the `Exchange rate dates` page, where he may see how the currency exchange rate changed based on the time period. 

### That's about it. However, there is one thing left. Please keep in mind that the websites are "Work In Progress", which means that some html/css/js files may change during updates. Also you can ask for whatever Front-End feature you want to be implemented and it will be so. Good Luck!
